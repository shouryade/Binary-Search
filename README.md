# Binary Search : The Force Awakens

Welcome to The Binary Search: The Force Awakens, a practice repository for myself for solving DSA problems on binary search ! 🚀

## What is Binary Search?

Binary search is an efficient algorithm used to search for a specific element in a sorted collection of data. It follows the divide-and-conquer approach and significantly reduces the search space with each comparison. The algorithm repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target element is found or determined to be absent.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains:

- **Implementation**: Binary Search algorithm implementation in C++, and some tricks using the C++ STL for binary search.
- **Problem Set**: A set of binary search problems to practice and improve my binary search skills.

May the binary search be with you! 🌌
